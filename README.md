# James and Zixi 2D game Collab
 
Hi John!
The game prototype is currently in the BreadKnight folder named "project.godot". We are not thinking of moving the game file to a different folder for now, becasue we are afraid that doing so will break the file structure and things won't load correctly.
As for now, we are working on the projectile system for our characters by learning with YouTube :) later we will work on enemy behavior, enemy and character spawn system, and embedding the kitchen scene.
