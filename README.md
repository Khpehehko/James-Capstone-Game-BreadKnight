# James and Zixi 2D game Collab BreadKnight
 
Hi John!

The game prototype is currently in the BreadKnight folder named "project.godot".

Modified Mar 5:

-We have differentiated the moving speed of each character

-We have vastly improved and automated the projectile system of each character, now the projectile follows the cursor

-Next step will be modifying the projectile so that the bullet will follow approaching enemies, this will be done after we finish working on the enemy ai.

-Also, we will fix character controls so that the player can control each character separately using the method you have mentioned in class. 

By finishing the programming mentioned above, we will have a working prototype, and hopefully the game will be in good shape by the end of spring break!

Update on Mar 8: Please welcome Mr. Baugette! He is a long, slim, tubular French missile who wants to crush all the kitchen threats. He is an expert at drag racing and can move faster than anyone else.

Unlike Bread Knight, Mr Baugette doesn't shoot flour bullets, he crashes into all enemies in sight and deals tons of damage.

Although his profile means he is not good at going around corners, he can sprint like no one else if you press the space key while maneuvering him through obstacles. However, keep in mind that he can only sprint for 5 seconds before running out of stamina and enters a 7 sec recovery stage. Use the sprint wisely!

Meanwhile, we have developed a simple hitbox and AI for testing. Say hello to butter patrols!

For now, we are working on adding enemy animations, dmg and attack system (hitpoints and health), and embedding the kitchen scene.

Cheers!
