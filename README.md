# James and Zixi 2D game Collab
 
Hi John!

The game prototype is currently in the BreadKnight folder named "project.godot".

Modified Mar 5:

-We have differentiated the moving speed of each character

-We have improved the projectile system of each character

-Next step will be modifying the projectile so that the bullet will follow approaching enemies, this will be done after we finish working on the enemy ai.

-Also, we will fix character controls so that the player can control each character separately using the method you have mentioned in class. 

As for now, we are working on the projectile system for our characters by learning with YouTube :) later we will work on enemy behavior, enemy and character spawn system, and embedding the kitchen scene.

By finishing the programming mentioned above, we will have a working prototype, and hopefully the game will be in good shape by the end of spring break!

Cheers!
